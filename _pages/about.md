Hi! I’m **Yanlong Zhao (赵衍龙)**, a researcher focusing on **AI for Science** and **geometric deep learning**. My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and biomedical knowledge graphs, with a particular interest in building models that are both predictive and mechanistically interpretable.

## Research interests
- Graph & hypergraph neural networks for biological networks
- Multimodal representation learning (molecules, proteins, diseases, text) and alignment in shared latent spaces
- Robust evaluation and reproducible ML for scientific discovery

## Current projects (selected)
- **MuSHIN**: Hypergraph-based unsupervised learning for metabolic gap-filling and reaction prediction in genome-scale metabolic models.  
- **DREAM-GNN**: Multimodal graph learning for drug–disease association prediction, including cold-start / zero-shot settings.

## I’m looking for
I’m interested in collaborating on problems related to **biomedical graph learning** and **foundation models for biology**. If you think our interests align, feel free to reach out.
