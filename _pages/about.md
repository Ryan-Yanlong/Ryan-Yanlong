Hi! I’m **Yanlong Zhao (赵衍龙)**, a researcher focusing on **AI for Science** and **Geometric Machine Learning**. My work sits at the intersection of machine learning and biomedical knowledge graphs, with a particular interest in building models that are both predictive and mechanistically interpretable. I am currently working under the supervision of [**Prof. Ren Wang**](https://wangren09.github.io/) and [**Prof. Can Chen**](https://tarheels.live/canc/), focusing on AI-driven methods for biomedical discovery and biological network modeling.

## Photography

Outside of my research, I am passionate about photography.  
I work with both digital and film formats.

## Research interests
- Graph & hypergraph neural networks for biological networks
- Multimodal representation learning (molecules, proteins, diseases, text) and alignment in shared latent spaces


## Current projects (selected)
- **MuSHIN**: Hypergraph-based unsupervised learning for metabolic gap-filling and reaction prediction in genome-scale metabolic models.  
- **DREAM-GNN**: Multimodal graph learning for drug–disease association prediction.
